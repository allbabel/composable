# Overview

Proposes flow to do runtime upgrades of Picasso. 

In its core [upgrades] are as described by Parity for developer network.

Extended with security measures, like Karura and Kusama have, to protect liqiudity on these networks.

Expected that the reader has understood official Parity documents and explainers regarding upgrades and [governance].

## Constraints

- Upgrades can be done only under `Root` origin.
- Upgrades are not immediate because runtime should be copied to the majority of parachain collators and relay validators and be enabled simultaneously on a specific block in the future.

## Flow

### I want some code to be running in Picasso parachain

I make sure that:

- All code is on main protected branch of this repo.
- Code is part `dali` runtime configuration.
- Code is part of `picasso` runtime configuration.
- Relevant(see other documents regarding acceptance criteria) preliminary checks, tests, and audits passed for added code.
- I send git commit hash to #sre to ask to deploy `wasm` including that hash.

### As SRE, we help to deploy changes to the runtime

- Given valid and credible git hash
- We ensure that runtime `wasm` with referenced code is available in `GitHub Releases`
- We collect all hashes to include in the next runtime upgrade.
- We ask for consensus from @ComposableFi/testers (QA) and @ComposableFi/technical-writers (docs are up to date with runtime) and @ComposableFi/security and @ComposableFi/blockchain-integrations (UI/Frontend/Explorer) are for upgrade including relevant hashes

### With SUDO (key, multi-signature, proxy)

@ComposableFi/sre follow Parity docs on runtime upgrade.

### Without SUDO

- @ComposableFi/sre run CI job which uploads preimage to upgrade runtime on behalf of sudo
- Sent message to `council` members about the new upgrade.

### Council collective

- Creates default YES voting on democracy
- Votes yes with their funds

### Technical collective

- Fast tracks enactment
